todo

* extra details for "atomic operations" slide: "lock-free" for "steps"
* master copy vs snapshot correctness
X fix push_back tries with correct colors, and showing persistent steps
* diagram showing IDs
* diagrams for freeze, detach, reattach, detect/resolve
* extra notes about resolution: which procs/threads do resolution on which values?
X heat equation implementation/conversation
    * diagram showing dependency graph for a stencil
P look at other "future directions" and add in
    P partitioning problem
X fill in all emtpy slides
* conclusion

X "inner workings" isn't a great title for that slide
X define "transient"
X talk about width
P talk about indexmaps, operators, etc earlier on: "algebra", "tracker"
X between detach and reattach...?
P for reattach: talk about branch-copying as code
    * pathological caes for branch-copying, etc
P talk about using IDs for conflict detection optimization
! wrt the code: try to avoid "where did this come from" type magic
