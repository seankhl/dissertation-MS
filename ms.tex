We implement a vector, using a bit-partitioned trie, that allows for consistent
concurrent reading and writing between multiple tasks under some constraints on
the properties of those tasks. This data structure, along with a work queue and
a framework for resolving operations that conflict with each other, yields a
method for automatically parallelizing a graph of tasks that may have
synchronization requirements under traditional memory models. We test the
method against other shared-memory parallelism techniques, including C++
threads and OpenMP directives, by invoking repeated reduce and
foreach operations on an initial random input in the MB to GB scale, as well
as by implementing and benchmarking a solution to the 1-dimensional heat
equation. Our method achieves comparable scaling results and similar raw
performance. It beats serial implementations on a dual-core machine and runs
only 4\% to 50\% slower than the best-performing parallel technique on up to 16
logical cores, without requiring manual synchronization between steps and while
providing greater algorithmic flexibility.

The original idea to use persistent and transient data structures in other
settings came from very useful conversations with Matt Rocklin, who was my
student mentor at the University of chicago before he graduated. My advisor,
Ridgway Scott, and my classmate, Hannah Morgan, both contributed thoughts and
direction, as well as listened patiently to me formulate my ideas out loud.
Another student, Daniel Reid, provided a valuable skepical perspective on
automated synchronization. Finally, without Chris Okazaki's book Purely
Functional Data Structures or Rich Hickey's work on Clojure (and the
corresponding talks), there would be no groundwork for this paper in the first
place.
%   Ridgway Scott, my advisor, has provided me with the opportunity to pursue my
%   ideas about parallel methods and synchronization, entrusting me to flesh out
%   my own research topic and allowing me to gain experience in turning my own ideas
%   into real research, for better or worse. He helped me turn a much less concrete
%   and perhaps unreasonably ambitious research goal into something manageable.

%   Anne Rogers helped me get my thoughts organized and helped plant the seed for
%   the formalization of my ideas and their commitment to writing.

%   John Reppy provided some discussion and background on the topic of parallelism
%   adn synchronization with regard to its development in data structures and
%   programming langauges, which brought some needed context to the work I wanted to
%   do.

%   Janos Simon has provided the structure and support that has invaluably helped me
%   continue making progress and eventually complete this work.

%   John Santerre read my paper with me and gave me the dialogue necessary to
%   reformulate my paper in a way that made it more readable, clear, and developed.
%   Without his guidance, I would not have been able to express my ideas with as
%   much precision.

%   Hannah Morgan always listened to me when I ranted about my ideas, even the ones
%   that don't make sense, and got coffee with me when my energy was waning. She
%   provided the most honest sanity check to any ideas I had.

%   My family has always done a great job of supporting me and encouraging my
%   passion for math and computer science, and very pateintly sit and listen when I
%   try to explain my work to them.
